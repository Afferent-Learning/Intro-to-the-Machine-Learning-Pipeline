# Course Introduction
The ambitious goal of this course is to teach anyone who knows some basic python programming how to effectively execute modern machine learning techniques on any dataset. This course is an ongoing, free, opensource project and will cover a wide array of information from linear algebra, calculus, data science, artificial intelligence and computer vision. 

**It should be noted that this course is an intro course**. 

There are many topics that have incredible depth and detail which will not be fully explored. If you are feeling that the curriculum is not detailed enough please let us know, but also consider exploring the [Deep Learning Specializations](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) by deeplearning.ai or the [Stanford Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?) taught by Andrew Ng. 

## Suggested Prerequisites:
As the course continues to evovle, we will be trying our best to guide as many people as possible through the pipeline. Currently the suggested prequisites are as follows:

- Familiarity with programmming in Python 3
- Understaing of classes, libraries, and functions
- Understanding how to read graphs and diagrams

## Required Prerequities:
In order to standardize the quality of learning and create reliable community support for debugging, we will be using the executable document platform [Google Colaboratory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI). In order to use Google Colab, all you need is a Google Account. More details on how and why we use this platform will be described in our course material.
